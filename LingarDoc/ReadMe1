It’s interface, always need to be implemented by some object. 
SO the basic is CrudRepository<T,ID>, 
and in the tutorial it’s work with . PagingAndSortingRepository<T,ID>
Let’s do some little playing with that. 

The repository generate automatically a table with the object properties. 

It's pretty cool. Yeah.

Look here some cools method that u have available. 
And I think that paging is extends this too , SO all available too. 

Crud and paging are also interface. U need to implement them, and make the methods specified in them .
But in fact we just extends this inteface too, and use it in the spring. 
The difference between paging to the regular CRUD interface, that in the paging u can ask the page size by ?size=3 for example.
