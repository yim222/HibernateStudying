Hibernate Studying - Main

Lesson 3 - 

In this lesson - 

We create a service to create and pass Entities to others in organize and clean way . 

- See the "entitiesService". 

We need that singlePropName will be unique , so we create an initial entities of that. 
Then we generate in the service a method that get Map<String, String> values of the values u want (suppose to be passed
to a "SocialEvent") and generate from that the wanted array with the "exist" propNames entities. 

Finally we create from that in the DataLoader1 , a new Social event. 

So if u want to create new SocEvent just change those row in the class and restart : 

singlePropsValues.put("name", "Shirley Games");
singlePropsValues.put("address", "Kefar Saba");

- Trying to make a component server that I can use it as I want by invocation .
