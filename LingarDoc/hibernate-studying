Hibernate Studying - Main

Lesson 2 - 

In this lesson - We have Study 

-That If u want flexibilty with the entities flow - U need to do repositories to each of them. 
- After U do it U don't need to do casading in the nested Entities . 
- If u want to use entity that exist - U need to get it from the DB . 


How to understand this ? 

- See the new Repositories I did in the package. And pass on Dataloader carefully. It's not a lot. 
- Follow the explantion there, and DONT forget to change the unique field , and also - match the ID"S if necessay  .
