Lesson 8 -  

part 1 - is about derived queries methods
part 2 - is about manually defined named queries

*******************************
- I am creating new simple entity - car with owner , company, year - as date, price - as integer . 

Trying to study that :
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#jpa.repositories

- If u want to take just some of the methods of the CRUD repo u can do it in that way : 

https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.definition-tuning

2 TYPES OF QUERIES IN SPRING - DATA : 

1- Derived Query, is query that U define the signature in the interface (they derived from the repository definition)
2- Manual Query is query that U write by your self (and use @Query for get it active ) 

or as described in the guide : 

By deriving the query from the method name directly.

By using a manually defined query.

*** 
By default the Repository proxy use in strategy that look for declared manually Query and if not found it's look for method name-based query. 
U can change it to be that or that by changing the configuration : 

https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.details

U can see here 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.query-lookup-strategies

***

Named method queries : 

To the "By" word have a lot of meaning. It's the start of the criteria. as U can see here : 

https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.query-methods.query-creation

-- here is the list of the optional parameters

-- here https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#jpa.java-config
and above and below he is talking a lot about configuration. It's for sure need to be know. But for
now it's happen automatically in this project. Not sure exactly how.
